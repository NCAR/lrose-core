 * DESCRIPTION:    
 * 	EG_edm_2d - Given an array of intervals corresponding to a set of

 * the clump.  The underlying data is assumed to be offset in the
 * following manner:
 *
 * 2D Example:
 *
 * o o o o o
 * o x x x o
 * o x x x o
 * o x x x o
 * o o o o o
 *
 * By staging the data in this manner, the euclidean distance map
 * algorithm is significantly simplified.  A conversion routine,
 * translate_array, is provided to convert the output array back to an
 * array without the extra rows and columns of zeroes.

 * DESCRIPTION:
 * EG_simple_edm_2d - This has the same purpose as

 * a value corresponding to its distance to the boundary of the clump.
 * The underlying data is assumed to be offset in the following manner:

 * 2D Example:
 *
 * o o o o o
 * o x x x o
 * o x x x o
 * o x x x o
 * o o o o o
 *
 * By staging the data in this manner, the euclidean distance map
