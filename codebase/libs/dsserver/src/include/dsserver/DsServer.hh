// 
// DsServer -- Base Server Class for DIDSS
// 
//             Paddy McCarthy - Jan 1999
// 
// Design Notes:
// -------------
// 
// This threaded server uses a Boss and Worker thread model. 
//   o A Boss thread is initiated by an external call to waitForClients().
//   o Worker threads are spawned by the Boss to handle individual clients.
//   o The Boss does no management of Worker threads after they are
//       spawned. However, the number of clients at any time may be 
//       obtained through the _numClients data member.
//   o A special "timer" thread runs continuously and checks for server
//       quiescence. If the server is quiescent for an excessive period
//       of time (more than _maxQuiescentSecs), the timer thread calls 
//       exit(0). For ease of explanation the timer thread is considered
//       a Worker thread in the following description, though it's pay is
//       higher because it's a specialist.
// 
// The DsServer class is abstract (cannot be instantiated), because it
//   does not contain definitions of all the methods it needs to be a
//   fully-functional server. Specifically, it contains no behavior for
//   handling a client request once it is received. To use this class, 
//   create a subclass which defines the handleDataCommand() method, 
//   which will respond to requests from clients.
// 
//   The DsServer class contains the functionality that is shared between 
//   all DIDSS servers:
//    o Waits on an indicated port for client connections.
//    o Accepts client connections, and reads a client request, which
//        must be a DsServerMsg.
//    o Interprets the client DsServerMsg header to determine if the request
//        is for data or for server information.
//    o Upon interpreting the message header, calls the appropriate virtual
//        method for the request: handleServerCommand() or handleDataCommand().
//    o Inits the procmap when constructed.
//    o Registers with the procmap after every client Worker thread is spawned,
//        and every time waitForClients() times out waiting for clients.
//    
//   The DsServer class has these additional capabilities, which subclasses
//   may chose to use if they are relevant to a particular server implementaion:
//    o Subclass may perform additional tasks every time waitForClients() times
//        out, by defining a virtual timeoutMethod().
//    o Subclass may perform additional tasks after every time waitForClients() 
//        spawns a Worker thread, by defining a virtual postHandlerMethod().
//    o Subclass may perform pre-exit tasks (when the server becomes
//        quiescent) by defining a virtual exitMethod().
//    o Constructor takes arguments such as port number, and max quiescent
//        secs, to support DIDSS server executables which must take -port
//        and -qmax args.
// 
//   Subclassing notes:
//    In general, when subclasses define special virtual methods such as 
//    timeoutMethod() and exitMethod(), these MUST first call the DsServer::
//    version of the method before doing any other tasks. Header comments
//    indicate when this is necessary.
// 
//    The handleDataCommand() and handleServerCommand() methods are run
//    on Worker threads, and so should not modify and data members on the
//    class without first locking a mutex. Initial server implementations
//    use a fine-grained approach for mutex scope (one mutex per data member)
//    with good success. This approach reduces collisions between Worker
//    threads. It's also obvious what *should* be locked when a data member
//    is modified. The tradeoff is more mutexes and more mutex management.
//    Also note that it is good policy to lock mutexes when *READING* data
//    that is potentially being modified by more than one thread. When you 
//    define a mutex for a data member, use it for reads AND writes to the
//    data member.
//
// Maintenance Issues:
// -------------------
// 
// When coding and debugging this class I found it necessary to keep in 
//   mind two things at all times:
//     - Is the method I am working in called by the Boss, Worker, or both?
//     - Is any data member being modified? If so, what are the assumptions
//         about the modification of this data?
//
// Data modification assumptions:
// * Two data members are modified both by the Boss and Worker threads:
// *     _numClients
// *     _lastActionTime
// *   Coordination of the modifications is done through mutexes. It
// *   is absolutely necessary to obtain the appropriate mutex lock 
// *   before modifying these data members. It's recommended to obtain
// *   such locks before accessing the data. The tradeoff for potential
// *   reduction in performance is fewer *very-hard-to-find* bugs!
// *                                      -----------------
// * 
// * Some data members are updated by only the Boss thread:
// *     _isOkay
// *     _errString
// *   These data members are not protected by mutexes because there 
// *   is only one boss, so concurrency is not an issue.
// * 
// *   Worker threads should never modify this data, though there is
// *   no protection from it in the design. Providing this protection
// *   would require putting all the Worker thread functionality in 
// *   a separate class, which would add to the complexity and to the
// *   overhead of creating server subclasses (would require subclassing
// *   two classes instead of one).
// * 
// * Some data members are set in the constructor and should never be modified:
// *     _serverSocket;
// *     _executableName;
// *     _instanceName;
// *     _port;
// *     _maxQuiescentSecs;
// *     _maxClients;
// *     _forkClientHandlers;
// *     _isDebug;
// *     _isVerbose;
// *     _isSecure
