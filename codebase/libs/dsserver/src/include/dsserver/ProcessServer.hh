//////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// 
// ProcessServer -- Simple Base Server Class
//
// This class uses child processes for the main activities.
// 
// Mike Dixon - Feb 2009
// 
// Design Notes:
// -------------
// 
// This server spawns a child for each client connection received:
//   o A Boss process is initiated by an external call to waitForClients().
//   o Worker threads are spawned by the Boss to handle individual clients.
//   o The Boss does no management of Worker threads after they are
//     spawned. The the number of clients is determined by checking for
//     children which have exited.
// 
// The ProcessServer class is abstract (cannot be instantiated), because it
//   does not contain definitions of the handleClient() methods.
//   Specifically, it contains no behavior for
//   handling a client request once it is received. To use this class, 
//   create a subclass which defines the handleClient() method for
//   writing to and reading from the client.
// 
//   The ProcessServer class contains the following functionality:
//    o Waits on an indicated port for client connections.
//    o Accepts client connections
//    o Registers with the procmap after every client Worker thread is spawned,
//        and every time waitForClients() times out waiting for clients.
//      Note: PMU initialization must be done by the parent which instantiates 
//            this object.
//    
//   The ProcessServer class has additional capabilities, which subclasses
//   may chose to use if they are relevant to a particular server implementaion:
//    o Subclass may perform additional tasks every time waitForClients() times
//        out, by defining a virtual timeoutMethod().
//    o Subclass may perform additional tasks after every time waitForClients() 
//        spawns a Worker thread, by defining a virtual postHandlerMethod().
//    o Subclass may perform pre-exit tasks by defining a virtual exitMethod().
// 
//   Subclassing notes:
//    In general, when subclasses define special virtual methods such as 
//    timeoutMethod() and exitMethod(), these MUST first call the
//    ProcessServer::version of the method before doing any other tasks.
//    Header comments indicate when this is necessary.
// 
//    The handleClient() method is run in the child process.

class ProcessServer {
  
public:

  //   o Registers with procmap
  //   o Opens socket on specified port

  // Block and wait for clients.
  //   If a positive timeoutMSecs is provided, the wait times out,
  //     PMU registration is performed, and timeoutMethod() is called.
  //   If a non-positive timeoutMSecs is provided,
  //     the server will only register with PMU when a client request
  //     is received.

  // Threads: This method defines the Boss thread behavior.

  //               the return from timeoutMethod() or postHandlerMethod().
  //          -1 - something terrible happened.
