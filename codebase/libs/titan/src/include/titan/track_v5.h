  /* 
   * TRACK FILE FORMATS
   * ------------------
   *
   * There are two files for each date - a header file and a data file.
   *
   * Header file.
   * -----------
   *
   * file label - char[R_FILE_LABEL_LEN]
   *
   * header - struct track_file_header_t
   *
   * si32 complex_track[header->n_complex_tracks]
   *   this stores the numbers of the complex tracks, which are in
   *   ascending order but not necessarily contiguous.
   *
   * si32 complex_track_offset[header->n_complex_tracks]
   *   these are the file offsets to the complex_track_params_t struct
   *   for each complex track.
   *
   * si32 simple_track_offset[header->n_simple_tracks]
   *   these are the file offsets to the simple_track_params_t struct
   *   for each simple track.
   *
   * track_file_scan_index_t scan_index[header->n_scans]
   *   info about the track entry list for a given scan number
   *
   * si32 n_simples_per_complex[header->n_simple_tracks]
   *   This array lists the number of simple tracks per complex track
   *
   * si32 simples_per_complex_offsets[header->n_simple_tracks]
   *   This array lists the offsets for the arrays which contain
   *   the simple track numbers for each complex track
   *
   * For each complex track:
   *
   *   si32 simples_per_complex[n_simples_per_complex[icomplex]]
   *     This array holds the simple track numbers for the
   *     relevant complex track number. The array offsets are
   *     stored in simples_per_complex_offsets.
   *
   * Data file.
   * ---------
   *
   * file label - char[R_FILE_LABEL_LEN] followed by
   * track_data (described below).
   *
   * The track data is made up of the following structs:
   *
   *   complex_track_params_t
   *   simple_track_params_t
   *   track_file_entry_t
   *
   * Each complex track has a complex_track_params_t struct.
   * The offset of this struct is obtained from the complex_track_offset
   * array in the header file.
   * 
   * Each complex track is made up of one or more simple tracks.
   * Each of these has a simple_track_params_t struct pointed at by the
   * simple_track_offset array in the header file.
   *
   * Each simple track is made up of one or more track entries.
   * The entries for a simple track are stored as a doubly-linked list.
   * The offset to the first entry in the list is obtained from the
   * simple_track_params_t struct (first_entry_offset).
   *
   * The entries for a given scan are also stored as a singly-linked list.
   * The offset to the first entry in the list is obtained from the
   * scan index array in the header file. Using this list allows one
   * to get data on all of the entries at a given time (scan).
   *
   * DATA RETRIEVAL
   * --------------
   *
   * A track is made up of a complex track and one or more simple tracks.
   * A simple track is a part of a complex track which has no mergers or
   * splits in it. A complex track is therefore made up of a number of 
   * simple tracks.
   *
   * To retrieve a complex track, find its position in the array by searching
   * for the track number in complex_track_num[].
   *
   * Then read the complex_track_params_t struct at the offset given by
   * complex_track_offset[].
   *
   * Then for each of the simple tracks in the complex track
   * read the simple_track_params_t at the offset
   * given by simple_track_offset[].
   *
   * The first entry in a simple track is pointed to by first_entry_offset
   * in the simple params. Read in the first entry. The entries form a
   * linked list, with the next_entry_offset pointing to the next
   * entry in the simple track.
   *
   * You may also retrieve the entries relevant to a particular scan.
   * The scan_index array contains the number of entries and the offset to
   * the first entry for that scan. Read in the first track entry, and then
   * follow a (second) linked  list to other entries in the scan by using the
   * next_scan_entry_offset values in the entry.
