MDV Concepts
------------

MDV (Meteorological Data Volume) is a general purpose data file format 
for storing one- two- and three-dimensional gridded data.

The MDV file format is self-documenting and provides capabilities for managing
multiple data fields in a single file.  For example, one MDV file might
contain a data volume with three tilts of radar reflectivity and radial 
velocity, along with a model-generated volume of wind vectors at these 
three tilts.

MDV supports constant spacing of data in the x-y plane of each field, 
i.e. a single delta-x and delta-y for all vertical levels within each field.  
However, delta-x and delta-y may vary from field to field.  In the 
third dimesion, MDV supports
both variable and constant data spacing.  

A simple example of a radar MDV file is one with two data fields, reflectivity
and velocity, where (x,y,z) represents (range, azimuth, elevation) and where:

    field   field   num num num    min   min   min    delta delta delta
    name    units    x   y   z      x     y     z       x     y     z
    -----   -----   --- --- ---   ----- ----- -----   ----- ----- -----
    DBZ     dBZ     600 360  2    0.375  0.0   0.0    0.25   1.0   1.0
    VEL     m/s     600 360  2    0.375  0.0   0.0    0.25   1.0   1.0

In this example, a look into a few of the headers fields might reveal:

    MasterHeader.vlevel_included:         true

    FieldHeader(DBZ).proj_type:           Radar Polar

    VlevelHeader(DBZ).vlevel_type[0]:     Elevation Angle
    VlevelHeader(DBZ).vlevel_type[0]:     Elevation Angle
    VlevelHeader(DBZ).vlevel_params[0]:   0.5
    VlevelHeader(DBZ).vlevel_params[1]:   1.45
  
Units for x and y are defined implicitly by the field's projection type.
In this example, the "Radar Polar" projection type prescribes units
of km for x (r), deg for y (az).  The units for z are defined implicitly
by the field's vlevel type.  In this example, vlevel headers are included
so the type is taken from the vlevel header for each level
and the "Elevation Angle"
vlevel type prescribes units of deg for z.  The vlevel_params array
gives the elevation angle for each vertical level.
A more complex use of the MDV file format might be one in which 
the above radar data is stored in the first two fields with a
third field containing model data output in a cartesian projection
with variable units in the z-dimension.

The MDV file format is extensible in that it provides space and access 
capabilities for generic "chunk" data defined by the MDV user.  Chunk
data allows MDV users to attach to their datasets additional information 
that is not already stored in the MDV header information.  Examples of
chuck data might be detailed data collection information such as
satellite or radar metadata.

In addition to the defined MDV file format, a library of application 
programmer's interface (API) functions provide simple facilities for 
reading and writing MDV files.

Other features of the MDV file format and library API include:

   1.  a FORTRAN-compatible I/O structure (for non-compressed data);
   2.  date/time stamping for creation, expiration, and forecasting;
   3.  support for data compression/decompression;
   4.  byte swapping to handle cross-platform data representation schemes.


Overview of the MDV file format
-------------------------------

The MDV FILE STRUCTURE looks like the following:

         MDV_master_header
         MDV_field_header 1
         MDV_field_header 2
           ...
         MDV_field_header n
         MDV_vlevel_header 1  (optional)
         MDV_vlevel_header 2
           ...
         MDV_vlevel_header n
         MDV_chunk_header 1   (optional)
         MDV_chunk_header 2
           ...
         MDV_chunk_header n
         field 1 data
         field 2 data
           ...
         field n data
         chunk 1              (optional)
           ...
         chunk n

All MDV header information appears at the beginning of the file
followed by the field data and any chunk data.


MDV Headers
-----------
A master header is followed by a field header for each of the fields 
in the dataset.  The master header and field headers are required.

Optional vlevel headers follow the field headers.  Vlevel headers are
only necessary for data with variable spacing or variable units
in the third
dimension.  In such a case, the vlevel headers are used to store the
details of the third dimension data, e.g. radar elevation angles.  
For datasets
with constant spacing and units in the third dimension, 
the master header and/or field headers
contain sufficient information for interpreting the data.  Although
the vlevel headers are optional, if one vlevel header exists for a
field, then a vlevel header must exist for each field in the dataset.  
A flag in the master header indicates whether or not vlevel headers 
are included in the dataset.

Following the vlevel headers are optional chunk headers.  The structure
and content of the chunk data is defined by the 
application programmer.  Thus, interpreting chunk data requires "a priori"
knowledge of the structure and contents of the chunk.


MDV Data
--------
Data records for each MDV field follow all header information. Chunk data,
if it is available, is at the end of the MDV file.  

Because MDV is built upon an in-house portability library (dataport), datatypes
within MDV are specified using dataport typedefs rather than
compiler-specific data types.  Following are the dataport types used within MDV:

     typedef signed char               si08;   // 1 byte
     typedef unsigned char             ui08;   // 1 byte
     typedef signed short              si16;   // 2 bytes
     typedef unsigned short            ui16;   // 2 bytes
     typedef signed int                si32;   // 4 bytes
     typedef unsigned int              ui32;   // 4 bytes
     typedef float                     fl32;   // 4 bytes
     typedef double                    fl64;   // 8 bytes

     // available only under IRIX6, DECOSF1, and SUNOS5_64
     typedef signed long long int      si64;   // 8 bytes
     typedef unsigned long long int    ui64;   // 8 bytes

The MDV file format has been 
designed to support various datatypes (bytes, shorts, integers, and floats).
However, to date, only unsigned 8-bit integers (ui08) are implemented.  
In order to handle
data ranges beyond that available with ui08 (0-255), MDV provides
a bias and scaling factor in each field header.  
The sample code provided below shows examples
of using bias and scale for reading and writing mdv data.

MDV data may be stored in a compressed form.  The compression scheme used
is a run-length encoding of the bytes in the data.  The data may be
encoded on a plane-by-plane basis (MDV_PLANE_RLE8 format) or on a row-by-
row basis (MDV_ROW_RLE8 format).  Again, only compression of byte data
is supported.

For a detailed explanation of MDV data compression, see the MDV file
description in the mdv/mdv_file.h include file.


Application Programmer's Interface (API)
----------------------------------------
There are two libraries which can be used for manipulating MDV files:
libMdv.a which contains classes for manipulating the files within C++
programs and libmdv.a which contains routines for manipulating the
files with C programs.  Since RAP is moving towards using C++ for all
new development, this is the only library that will be fully supported
in the future.

The API for MDV consists of one of the MDV libraries, the
libraries upon which the MDV library is dependent,
and the header files needed for compiling applications which read
and write MDV files.  The C++ library, libMdv.a, is dependent on
the following libraries:

	libdidss.a
	librapformats.a
	libtoolsa.a
	libdataport.a

For the C++ library, the header file Mdv/Mdvx.hh gives the methods used
for manipulating MDV files.  To simplify the file, this file includes
several helper files (which should not be included directly in your
programs) to help define the Mdvx class:

	Mdvx_constants.hh	Constants used to define MDV files.
	Mdvx_enum.hh		Enums used in MDV files.
	Mdvx_typedefs.hh	Typedefs of headers, etc. in MDV files.
	Mdvx_print.hh		Prototypes for Mdvx printing methods.
	Mdvx_read.hh		Prototypes for Mdvx read methods.
	Mdvx_write.hh		Prototypes for Mdvx write methods.
	Mdvx_protected.hh	Protected members/methods for the Mdvx class.

The C library, libmdv.a, is dependent on the following libraries:

	librapformats.a
	libdataport.a
	libtoolsa.a

For the C library, the header file mdv/mdv_file.h contains structure
definitions for the MDV file format.  The header file mdv_macros.h
contains constants used in the MDV structures.  Function prototypes
for reading and writing MDV data are located in mdv_read.h and mdv_write.h
respectively, while general MDV handle prototypes are defined in mdv_handle.h.


Reading MDV Files in C++ Programs
---------------------------------
The easiest way to read or write an MDV file is using the Mdvx class
within a C++ program.

To read a file using the Mdvx class, you would use code like the
following:

        #include <Mdv/Mdvx.hh>

        Mdvx mdv_file;

	// Set up the read parameters

        mdv_file.clearRead();
        mdv_file.setReadPath("myfile.mdv");
	mdv_file.setReadEncodingType(Mdvx::ENCODING_FLOAT32);
        mdv_file.setReadCompressionType(Mdvx::COMPRESSION_NONE);
        mdv_file.setReadScalingType(Mdvx::SCALING_NONE);

	if (mdv_file.readVolume() != 0)
	{
	  cerr << "Error reading Mdv file myfile.mdv" << endl;
          exit(-1);
        }

        // Process the data here

If you only want to read particular fields, vertical levels, etc.,
there are more "setRead" methods to customize the read operation and
reduce the memory usage as needed.


Reading MDV Files in C Programs
-------------------------------
The easiest way to read an MDV file within a C program is using the
MDV handle routines in mdv/mdv_handle.h.  For example, you might use
the following code:

	#include <stdio.h>

	#include <mdv/mdv_handle.h>
	#include <mdv/mdv_read.h>

	MDV_handle_t mdv_handle;

	if (!MDV_init_handle(&mdv_handle))
        {
          fprintf(stderr, "Error initializing MDV handle structure.\n");
          exit(-1);
        }

	if (!MDV_handle_read_all(&mdv_handle,
                                 "myfile.mdv",
                                 MDV_FLOAT32,
                                 MDV_COMPRESSION_NONE,
                                 MDV_SCALING_NONE,
                                 1.0, 0.0))
	{
	  fprintf(stderr,
	          "Error reading MDV file myfile.mdv.\n");

	  exit(-1);
	}

	/*
	 * Process the data here
	 */

	MDV_free_handle(&mdv_handle);

The disadvantage to this method of reading an MDV file is that the entire
file contents are stored in memory.  If memory is a problem or if you're
only using a small portion of the MDV file, you may want to read in the
pieces of the MDV file you need when you need them.  For example, the
following code reads in the data for the third field (field number 2 since
everything starts counting at 0) in an MDV file:

	#include <stdio.h>

	#include <mdv/mdv_file.h>
	#include <mdv/mdv_read.h>

	FILE *mdv_file;

	MDV_master_header_t master_hdr;
	MDV_field_header_t field_hdr;
	ui08 *field_data;

	/*
	 * Open the MDV file
	 */

	if ((mdv_file = fopen("myfile.mdv", "r")) == NULL)
	{
	  fprintf(stderr,
	          "Error opening MDV file myfile.mdv for reading.\n");

	  exit(-1);
	}

	/*
	 * Read in the master header to make sure there are at least
	 * 3 fields in the file and to get the file contents locations.
	 */

	if (MDV_load_master_header(mdv_file, &master_hdr) != MDV_SUCCESS)
	{
	  fprintf(stderr,
	          "Error reading master header from file.\n");
	  fclose(mdv_file);
	  exit(-1);
	}

	if (master_hdr.n_fields < 3)
	{
	  fprintf(stderr,
	          "MDV file contains only %d fields, cannot get field 2.\n",
	          master_hdr.n_fields);
	  fclose(mdv_file);
	  exit(-1);
	}

	/*
	 * Read in the field header.
	 */

	if (MDV_load_field_header(mdv_file, &field_hdr, 2) != MDV_SUCCESS)
	{
	  fprintf(stderr,
	          "Error reading field header from MDV file.\n");
	  fclose(mdv_file);
	  exit(-1);
	}

	/*
	 * Now get the volume of data for the field.  The data will be
	 * returned as unsigned bytes, regardless of the actual format
	 * in the file.
	 */

	if ((field_data = (ui08 *)MDV_get_volume(mdv_file,
	                                         &field_hdr,
	                                         MDV_INT8))
	                == NULL)
	{
	  fprintf(stderr,
	          "Error reading data from MDV file.\n");
	  fclose(mdv_file);
	  exit(-1);
	}

	fclose(mdv_file);

	/*
	 * Process the data here.
	 */

	free(field_data);
