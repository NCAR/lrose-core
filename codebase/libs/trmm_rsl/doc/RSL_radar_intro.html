<hr>This library is an object oriented programming environment to keep
application programming simple, for the casual C programmer, as well as
for analysis software applicable to all RADAR data related to the TRMM
GV effort. This library reads the wsr88d, lassen, kwajalein, mcgill, toga,
UF, RAPIC and native RSL file formats. The most important functions provided
are those which load any one of the radar file formats into memory; see
<a href="RSL_anyformat_to_radar.html">RSL_anyformat_to_radar</a>. Additional
functions are provide to mainpulate the RSL objects. Nearly all of the
functions return objects. When they don't, they usually perform actions
like output, making images, etc. The most general object in RSL is <b>Radar</b>.
The structure <b>Radar</b> is the method used to define the ideal or universal
radar representation in RAM while keeping the natural resolution of the
data unchanged. More simply, <b>Radar</b> represents the super set of all
radar file formats. The <a href="RSL_structures.html">Radar structure</a>
is hierarchically defined such that it is composed of <b>Volumes</b>, each
containing one field type. <b>Volumes</b> are composed of <b>Sweeps</b>.
<b>Sweeps</b> are composed of <b>Rays</b> and <b>Rays</b> contains a vector
of the field type. Some field types are Reflectivity(DZ), Velocity(VR),
Spectrum Width(SW), etc. There are approximately 20 field types. See the
<a href="users_guide.html">Users Guide</a> and the <a href="whats_new.html">what's
new</a> for more information.
<p>An example of a function that returns the <b>Radar</b> object is the
<b>Lassen</b> ingest function. The function allocates all memory required
to store the values from the lassen file in RAM.
<p><tt>Radar *radar; radar = RSL_lassen_to_radar("lassen.file.22");</tt>
<p>Syntatically, the object returned is a pointer. However, the functions
provided in RSL treat this pointer as an object.
<p>The names of the functions in the library are very descriptive of the
function they perform. In the previous example, you may infer that some
conversion from <i>lassen</i> to <i>radar</i> is taking place. Knowing
that <i>lassen</i> is a file format for the Darwin RADAR datasets and that
<i>radar</i>
refers to the data structure <b>Radar</b> helps you understand that the
function ingests <i>lassen</i> files and loads it into the <b>Radar</b>
data structure.
<p>The data structure <b>Radar</b> is composed of other objects called
<b>Volumes</b>.
You will notice that throughout this discussion, the natural vocabulary
of the scientists who talk about the different components of the data received
from a RADAR is used. This vocabulary is used to describe each component
of the data structure. The <b>Radar</b> data structure holds RADAR measurements
of a volume of physical space for the smallest unit of time possible. Typically
a RADAR can produce a volume of data in 5 to 8 minutes; that becomes the
smallest unit of time for a volume. This volume of space measured is referred
to as <b>Volume</b>, in the RSL, and represents one particular measurement
type or field type. The types of measurements are: reflectivity, velocity,
spectrum width, quality controlled reflectivity, total reflectivity, differential
reflectivity and LDR (another form of differential reflectivity). Normally,
the RADAR records as many fields that it is designed to record and that
really is one volume. However, I have split the fields into seperate volumes
so that you can concentrate on only one field type. Thus, the <b>Radar</b>
datatype is composed of an array of <b>Volumes</b>; one to the number of
fields.
<p>The <b>Volume</b> data structure, a single field type, is composed of
several 360 degree revolutions of the RADAR. These revolutions are refered
to as sweeps. The first sweep for a volume, commonly known as the base
scan, is the sweep made by the RADAR pointing nearly horizontally and directing
a RADAR beam toward the horizon. Then, the RADAR is tilted upwards slightly
and another revolution is performed. This process continues 10 to 16 times,
depending on the RADAR. These sweeps are referred to as <b>Sweep</b> in
the RSL. Thus, a <b>Volume</b> is simply composed of an array of <b>Sweeps</b>;
one to the number of elevation steps.
<p>Similiarly, a <b>Sweep</b> is defined as a collection of rays throughout
the 360 degree revolution. The RADAR takes measurements continually while
it is sweeping. The number of rays collected is typically a function of
the beamwidth. A beam width of .95 degrees will yield 379 rays for each
sweep. For nexrad data the number of rays collected for each sweep is approximately
366. These rays are referred to as <b>Ray</b> in the RSL. Thus, a <b>Sweep</b>
is simply an array of <b>Rays</b>; one to the number of rays.
<p>And, a <b>Ray</b> is one ray measurement from the RADAR. A ray is a
series of measurements from the minimum to the maximum range of the RADAR.
Think of it as a meaurement from zero to the maximum range while the RADAR
is at one azimuthal angle. In reality, the radar is revolving continuously.
The number of data values in a ray is represented in KM and it defines
the resolution of the RADAR. NEXRAD is typcally 1.0KM and the new SIGMET
RADAR is .25 KM. Thus, a <b>Ray</b> is simply an array of <b>Range</b>
values; one to the number of bin. The number of bins is defined by the
range of measured space divided by the resolution of a measurement less
any to the minimum range.
<p>Finally, a <b>Range</b> value is simply a floating point number that
represents the data.
<p>It should be obvious that the <b>Radar</b> data structure is an array
of <b>Volumes</b> which is an array of <b>Sweeps</b> which is an array
of <b>Rays</b> which is and array of <b>Ranges</b>. Whew! This hierarchial
description is easy to understand, when you only think of each object as
an array of the next subobject. Thinking of it as a 4 or 5 dimensional
array is very difficult.
