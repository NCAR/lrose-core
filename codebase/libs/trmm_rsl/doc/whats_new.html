What's new?</h1>

<h2>
Version 1.23 release (what's new since v1.18).</h2>
RSL&nbsp;now accpets the EDGE&nbsp;format.&nbsp; See <a href="RSL_edge_to_radar.html">RSL_edge_to_radar</a>.&nbsp;
KDP definition changed.&nbsp; It now normalizes the value based on the
radar wavelength.&nbsp; A bug in the RADTEC ingest routine was removed.&nbsp;
Other than that, mostly bug fixes that were very minor.&nbsp; Added <a href="RSL_color_table.html">RSL_set_color_table</a>
and <a href="RSL_color_table.html">RSL_get_color_table</a>.&nbsp; These
routines permit better user control of the color table.
<h2>
Version 1.18 release (what's new since v1.15).</h2>
This version adds the RADTEC format ingest routine.&nbsp; See <a href="RSL_radtec_to_radar.html">RSL_radtec_to_radar</a>.&nbsp;
RADTEC requires the use of the PKWARE Data Compression Library, available
from PKWARE, Inc., http://www.pkware.com.&nbsp; Also made several minor
bug fixes and the image generation was enhanced to allow generation of
images out to the range specified.&nbsp; Previously,&nbsp; image pixels
were 1km, now they are range/radius.
<h2>
Version 1.15 release (what's new since v1.14).</h2>
This version&nbsp; adds&nbsp; the RAPIC format ingest routine.&nbsp; See
<a href="RSL_rapic_to_radar.html">RSL_rapic_to_radar</a>.&nbsp;
A data truncation bug was fixed in the UF ingest.&nbsp; This bug only affects
the velocity data.&nbsp; The Lassen ingest no longer depends on (radar->h.name),&nbsp;
for calibration of Gunn Point data.&nbsp; It is now done based on time
periods of the data.&nbsp; Please see the <a href="CHANGES">CHANGES</a>
file for more information.
<h2>
Version 1.14 release (what's new since v1.11).</h2>
This version continues the minor bug fixes to the HDF component.&nbsp;
Additionally, it includes calibration for the Gunn Point radar, in Lassen
format.&nbsp;&nbsp; The distinction of Gunn Point data from other lassen
data is done by assumming the radar name (radar->h.name) is 'Gunn_Pt'.&nbsp;
Please see the <a href="CHANGES">CHANGES</a> file for more information.
<h2>
Version 1.11 release (what's new since v1.8).</h2>
Version 1.9 represented a bug fix to the HDF component.&nbsp; Version 1.10
represented a minor
<br>upgrade, mostly to the HDF component, but, other areas were modified
and that's why it is called an upgrade rather than a bug fix.&nbsp; Version
1.11 represents a minor bug fix release from v1.10.&nbsp; It only affects
the
<br>HDF components.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please see the <a href="CHANGES">CHANGES</a>
file for more detailed information regarding what changed.
<p>In version 1.10, ZDR color tables were modifed and a first draft of
the South Africa data format ingest routine was added.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Version 1.8 release (what's new since v1.7).</h2>
Added <a href="RSL_read_these_sweeps.html">RSL_read_these_sweeps</a>.&nbsp;
Specify specific sweep numbers for ingest.&nbsp; This drastically speeds
up ingest, if you're only interested in the first or first couple of sweeps.&nbsp;
For example, making base scans images.
<p>Added <a href="RSL_load_color_table.html">RSL_load_zdr_color_table</a>.
<p>More HDF mods; more warning messages.
<p>The TRMM Office has fixed several bugs in the TSDIS toolkit. For proper
HDF creation, that conforming to TSDIS HDF specifications, you will need
toolkit 4.5r1.1. Toolkit 4.5r1.1 is an unofficial release; the TRMM office
will pass this out upon request.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Version 1.7 release (what's new since v1.6).</h2>
This version fixes the lat/lon signs.&nbsp; Also, lat/lon are added to
each ray for UF when extended headers are available in SIGMET files.&nbsp;
Also, the HDF component has changed.&nbsp; This affects RSL_radar_to_hdf
and RSL_hdf_to_radar.
<h2>
Version 1.6 release (what's new since v1.5).</h2>
This version of RSL will work with TSDIS toolkit 4.5r1.&nbsp; UF now has
lat/lon stored for each ray, suitable for moving platforms.&nbsp; Also,
the wsr88d code does not default to KMLB.
<h2>
Version 1.5 release (what's new since v1.4).</h2>
The HDF component has changed again. This version of RSL will work with
toolkit 4.0 or toolkit 4.0.1. Version 4.0.1 is an un-official release of
the TSDIS toolkit. This version removes the temporary files created during
level 1 processing. There was only one file that changed, the file may
be obtained from the TRMM Office, upon request.
<p>One minor consistancy check was added to the wsr88d ingest; it checks
that the number of bins in a ray is reasonable. This problem usually manifests
itself from bad input files.
<h2>
Version 1.4 release (what's new since v1.0).</h2>
The HDF component is in a state of flux. The <a href="http://tsdis/tsdis/tsdistk.html">TSDIS
toolkit</a> keeps changing -- the interface keeps changing. The TSDIS toolkit
is, in the TRMM Office opinion, not stable. Their latest release is 4.0
and it has fixed many problems. One minor problem remains for level 1 processing:
temporary config files are not removed when the toolkit is closed.
<p>RSL is incorporated into a larger package called GVBOX. The latest version
of GVBOX is 1.1. GVBOX is a complete ground validation system to generate
TRMM GV products on pentium PCs running Linux. GVBOX is available on CDROM.
<p>RSL is now LGPL-ed.
<p>Added the routine <a href="RSL_select_fields.html">RSL_select_fields</a>
to reduce memory requirements upon reading data. This works very nicely
for LASSEN data where the number of fields is large, however, only 2 or
3 are needed.
<h2>
Version 1.0 release (what's new since v0.45).</h2>
Version 1.0 marks the jump from the previous stable version, version 0.45.
A few very minor bugs were encountered and repaired. But, the bulk of this
transisition is improved documentation with the addition of a Users Guide.
Additionally, the SIGMET ingest was repaired and can now read version 2
files, HDF I/O was added and the LASSEN ingest modified to read version
1.4 files. Version 1.4 LASSEN files were used during the MCTEX experiment.
Other than that, no major modifications were made. Technically, version
1.0 is a minor upgrade to RSL 0.45. But, due to the witnessed stability
of RSL, it was decided to call it version 1.0.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Can read compressed files automatically (new since v0.41)</h2>
Transparent, to all ingest routines the capability of filtering the input
data file through the GNU gzip program for decompressing the file has been
added. This feature does not appear to slow the I/O time and, in some cases,
especially on 486 pc's, improves overall throughput time. Two generic,
internal routines, have been added: <b>compress_pipe</b> and <b>uncompress_pipe</b>.
Each routine takes a <b>FILE *</b> and redirects it through <b>gzip</b>.
Each routine returns a new <b>FILE *</b>. Wsr88d files occupy 1/10 the
disk space when compressed and the TRMM Office plans to compress wsr88d
files to CDROM and 8mm tape for overall throughput savings for the production
system. It will no longer be necessary to decompress the data before processing
level 1.
<p>Similiarly, UF output can be saved using the gzip filter. The new routine
added is <a href="RSL_radar_to_uf.html">RSL_radar_to_uf_gzip</a> which
utilizes the gzip compression filter.
<h2>
Can read stdin (new since v0.39)</h2>
A new routine is provided called <a href="RSL_uf_to_radar.html">RSL_uf_to_radar_fp</a>
which takes an open file descriptor and returns a radar pointer. That file
pointer can be <b>stdin</b>. This special interface syntax, for the UF
ingest, is an exception to the interfaces that the other ingest routines
have. All other ingest routines, including <a href="RSL_uf_to_radar.html">RSL_uf_to_radar</a>,
have been modified to read stdin when the input filename is NULL. The complete
list of routines is: <a href="RSL_wsr88d_to_radar.html">RSL_wsr88d_to_radar</a>,
<a href="RSL_nsig_to_radar.html">RSL_nsig_to_radar</a>,
<a href="RSL_lassen_to_radar.html">RSL_lassen_to_radar</a>,
<a href="RSL_uf_to_radar.html">RSL_uf_to_radar</a>,
<a href="RSL_mcgill_to_radar.html">RSL_mcgill_to_radar</a>
and <a href="RSL_toga_to_radar.html">RSL_toga_to_radar</a>. The only routine
that will not accept stdin will be <a href="RSL_anyformat_to_radar.html">RSL_anyformat_to_radar</a>.
That routine will not be able to handle reading stdin because it needs
to read the first few bytes of the file to determine which ingest routine
to call. If you plan to make a filter program, you'll just have to know
what file format you expect: UF, nsig, wsr88d, etc.
