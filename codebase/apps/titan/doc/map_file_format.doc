FORMAT FOR MAP FILES                                            10/03/92
--------------------

Maps are stored in ascii files; this document describes their format.

These are the types of lines within the file:
	1) comment lines, which have the character "#" in column 1
	2) keyword lines, begining with a keyword
	3) lines of coordinate data following a keyword line

Coordinates are in (lat, lon), except for the ICONDEF, which has 
relative coords in pixels.

1. MAP_NAME <name> <desc>

This should be the first line of any map file. The name is restricted to
8 characters, and must not have whitespace in it. The description is restricted
to 64 chars.  A list of available map names (and desc) is passed to client
programs; typically it is displayed for the user to select from.

2. TRANSFORM <tranformation matrix>

Optional line used by digitizing program.  
   
3. PROJECTION <type> <parameters>

Optional line used by digitizing program. <type> = PJG_XXXX, as follows
   
#define PJG_POLAR_STEREOGRAPHIC_NORTH   1
#define PJG_OBLIQUE_STEREOGRAPHIC       2
#define PJG_LAMBERT_CONFORMAL2          3
#define PJG_TRANSVERSE_MERCATOR         4
#define PJG_FLAT                        5
#define PJG_STEREOGRAPHIC_ELLIPSOID     6
#define PJG_DENVER_ARTCC                7

4. ICONDEF <icon name> <npts>
    <x> <y>
    <x> <y>
    <x> <y>
		...
This defines an icon with name <icon name>. It consists of <npts> number
of points, which immediately follow.  The <x> <y> are in units of pixels, 
and the value "32767 32767" indicates a pen up.  Note this defines an
icon, but does not draw it.

5. ICON <icon name> <lat> <lon> <text x> <text y> <text>

This indicates to draw the icon <icon name>, with origin at <lat> <lon>.
If <text x> <text y> is not equal to "32767 32767", then also draw the
text <text>, with the lower left corner of the text at <text x> <text y> pixels
relative to the origin.

An ICON line can only refer to an <icon name> that is already defined by a
ICONDEF in the same map file.

An ICON stays the same size as the user zooms.


6. POLYLINE <name> <npts>
    <lat> <lon>
    <lat> <lon>
	    ...
This indicates an object called <name>, which is simply a polyline of
<npts> segments, specified in world (lat, lon) coordinates. Penup =
(-1000.0, -1000.0).

7. SIMPLELABEL <lat> <lon> <text>

Unscaleable label.

The text is centered on (<lat>,<lon>) in a font determined by the
display program. The text takes up the rest of the line after the
longitude, except for the space immediately after lon.

8. LABEL <ll lat> <ll lon> <ur lat> <ur lon> <rot. angle> <attach loc> <text>

Scaleable label.

These are specified in world coordinates, and scale as the user zooms.
Note all are space-delineated tokens with the exception of the text itself:

  `LABEL` in column 1.
  <ll lat> <ll lon> = lower left corner of the bounding rectangle
  <ur lat> <ur lon> = upper right corner of the bounding rectangle
  <rotation angle> = angle to rotate text in degrees: 
                     0 = regular, 90 = vertical text goes up,
                     180 = upside down, 270 = vertical text goes down
  <attach point> = lat, lon of the "attach point"; -1000, -1000 means none
  <text>=  text to display

9. PRODUCTS.

Products are described by some header lines, followed by a number of
graphic objects, such as ICON, POLYLINE, LABEL, SIMPLELABEL.

The header lines are:

PRODUCT  type sub_type num_objects group_id event_id
PRODUCT_TIME  data_time valid_time expire_time
PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION  (description string)

Times are 6 integers: year month day hour min sec

Examples are:
