# Legend Label: used for all on-screen labels and for movie/html file naming.
#           An Empty grid field can be obtained by using the keyword "None"
#
# Button Label:  used for all menus.
#
# URL:  is of the form:  mdvp:://host.domain:[port]:dir/dir&Field_name.
#                          (Run the DsServerMgr executable for mdvp service)
#   Spaces can be in field names by substituting a Caret character for the space:
#
#   Field^Name = "Field Name"
#   Field Index can alternatively be specified by prepending a '#' character to the field
#
# Colorscale:  Name of the file containing the value to color mapping for this field.
#
# Units:  A label used on the colorscales, etc.
#
# Cont-lo-hi-interv:  Default/Starting Contour low and high limits and interval.
# Note: Setting the Contour interval to 0.0 tells CIDD to use the colorscale
# for it's colors and values. This feature is used to produce color coded
# line contours.
#
# Rendering Format: The style to render the grid. Current options are:
#  cart:  - Rectangle/polygon fills of gridded data. (note "radial" is also
#           supported for backwards compatibility. CIDD now "auto detects"
#           datasets with non-rectangular grid cells.
#  cont:  - False color filled  contours.
#  lcont:  - Line contours.
#  dcont:  - Dynamic Contours - Automatically switches between cart & cont.
#          - Uses the 'cidd.dynamic_contour_treshold:' parameter
#  Note: Add the word "comp" to the format keyword to turn on composite request by default:
#     example:  cont,comp for a composite color filled contours.
#     example:  cart,comp for a composite filled polygon rendering
#        Add the word "autoscale" to the format keyword to turn on automatic colorscale scaling
#        (In this mode the colorscale will be expanded/shrunk to cover the dynamic range of the
#        data plane in memory, with regular, linear intervals.)
#     example:  cont,comp,autoscale for a composite color filled contours, that is autoscaled.
#
# Display_in_menu: Display this field in the main menu. (1 = Yes 0 = No)
# Bkgnd_Render: Render this field automatically in the background. (1 = Yes 0 = No)
#  Note: This is used to set up "toggle-able" field images for comparing two fields,
#  and to select which fields get generated in HTML output mode.
