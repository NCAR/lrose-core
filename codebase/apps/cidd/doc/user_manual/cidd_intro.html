<H3> CIDD Introduction and Overview</H3>

<P>
The display software, CIDD (Configurable, Interactive Data Display),
is primarily intended as a display system for real-time meteorological data. It also
provides capabilities for archival data display as well as a mode whereby
it outputs imagery for Web page integration.  It runs on a  wide variety
of Unix workstations using X-Windows graphics. Its principle
function is to integrate and display, in real-time, meteorological
information from disparate and distributed sources.  It combines visualizations of
gridded data along with other products (data) displayed as symbols or text,
overlaid with maps and other geographical symbols.  Graphics on the
display are automatically updated as new data arrives, and movie loops
shift forward in time as time passes.  The display's user interface
is designed to be operated without extensive training or reference to
detailed operators manuals. 
<P>
The architecture of the display and its data servers are flexible and
modular, allowing for easy integration of new data and its configuration
for a variety of locations and classes of users. Its client-server
design allows a wide variety of distributed storage topologies and
its http access modes allow for the tight integration with HTML based
data visualization. The user interface can be configured to display
just the minimum set of controls necessary to perform a task 
or can be configured to allow access to all the controls over product combinations,
colors, contour intervals, etc.
This allows the same software to be used by both
non-technical personnel with little or no training, as well as highly
technical users who want to customize the imagery and explore the data
in a variety of ways. CIDD's windows can be resized or closed on the
screen, making it compatible with other tools the user may wish to run
on the display workstation.

<P>
Gridded data can be visualized in a variety of ways; as color-filled
rectangles or trapezoids, in the case of radial data, as color
filled-contours and open contours. Wind fields may be displayed as wind
barbs, with or without labels or scalable vectors. Data from grids of
differing sources, resolutions or positions can be viewed simultaneously,
being automatically registered correctly onto the same image.

<P>
The imagery can be animated to form movie loops of 
products over time with the display automatically updating the
animation loop as new data arrives. Non-gridded data such as pilot
reports, meteorological station reports, or hazard areas, are 
displayed over the gridded products as colored lines, text, or iconic
symbols and can be displayed and updated during animation.

<P>
Users can select from a set of preset geographic domains or can
arbitrarily zoom over any region of the display. As the user zooms in,
additional detail in wind vectors, geographical overlays and symbolic products are
revealed. This feature prevents the display from becoming crowded with
too much graphics when viewing a regional area, yet allows the user to see
all of the available information when viewing a limited area.

<P>
Users may arbitrarily select a multi way point route, using the mouse, for
viewing vertical cross sections of the gridded data. The cross sections
are constructed on demand and can be animated along with the main plan
view imagery. Contours, and sets of wind vectors based on gridded data,
can be overlaid on top of the cross sectional data grids.

<P>
CIDD uses a flexible client-server mechanism to retrieve its data for
display.  Data are served to each user's workstation via TCP/IP network
protocols as the user requests different products or shifts their temporal
focus. Facilities for tunneling the data requests through http proxies
and the Apache http server can be added to enable access to data through
fire-walls. The client server architecture and protocols allows the
display to operate over both high bandwidth and low bandwidth networks
or PPP links.

<P>
CIDD's client-server data access mechanism is flexible and
configurable. Data distribution topologies can be set up to allow users
access to data that cannot be transmitted in their entirety down low
bandwidth or transiently connected networks.  Data can be automatically
pre-distributed to sites which have higher speed networks and whose
users need rapid access to large data sets.

<P>
CIDD supports RAP's fault tolerant mechanisms in situations where
the display will be used continuously for long periods of time. CIDD
produces a heartbeat which can be monitored for anomalies and restarted
if necessary. CIDD has run for months at a time without restart in
unattended settings, serving operations center personnel.

The Displays main features include:

<UL>
<LI> Easy to learn X based User interface - Supports 256 color and 16/24bit True-color Modes.
<LI> The most commonly used features are controllable from the main window or keyboard.
<LI> Integrates data from different sources and projections into one image.
<LI> Automatically updates imagery with as new data arrives.
<LI> Unlimited number of animated frames in loops.(Dependant on system memory available)
<LI> Predefined or Arbitrary Zoom on plan view displays
<LI> Arbitrary selection of cross sections via simple mouse actions.
<LI> Animation Speed and end of loop delays are user adjustable.
<LI> Displays up to 6 gridded fields simultaneously, layered over one another.
<LI> Overlays Contours of gridded data with user selectable intervals and color.
<LI> Overlays multiple  sets of wind barbs or scalable vectors.
<LI> Users may select/De select and change the color of geographic overlays. 
<LI> Font sizes and line widths are adjustable for contours and symbolic products.
<LI> Built in range rings and azimuth overlays with increasing detail on zooms.
<LI> Gridded data can be easily dimmed on 8 bit displays to enhance and clarify complex overlaid products.
<LI> Archival data can easily be accessed and displayed.
<LI> Distributed data model allows users to run the display from their desktop.
<LI> Config files, maps and color scales may be stored and accessed on a HTTP server.
</UL>


<P>
<H3> CIDD Can: </H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> Display data arrays collected in either rectangular or spherical
polar coordinates. Rectangular and polar data can be displayed
simultaneously on a Modified Mercator, Lambert Conformal, or Local Area
Cartesian projections. CIDD can display geographical maps, contours,
wind vectors or barbs and well as other data depicted as lines, symbols,
text and icons.

<LI> Define and display vertical cross sections along arbitrary
multi way-point routes.

<LI> Be used to draw simple lines and polygons for output
to other algorithms and displays. For example, CIDD can be used to draw
an area boundary for severe turbulence, and then distribute this warning
to other users in real-time.

<LI> Run on UNIX X based workstations using 8 to 32 bit depths.

<LI> Be use for Real-Time and Post Processing Modes of operation.

<LI> Automatically gather data from distributed databases
via client-server mechanisms. This facility allows the display to run
on any desk top workstation.  All displays can share the same data sources
and archives, preventing the duplication of data sets and large data
transfers. 

<LI> Allow users to interactively configure which data will appear on
their display, what geographical area the display will cover, and over
what time periods.

<LI> Display arbitrary vertical cross sections selected by pointing and
dragging.  Data field selection for horizontal and vertical views are
independent.

<LI> Can Zoom and Area Move its viewable domain, selected by clicking and dragging.

<LI> Overlay multiple data grids onto one another selectable range
transparency, as well as display  contour and wind vector overlays.

<LI> Generate Movie frame sequences that span over 8 hours.  Movie sequences
are not stored but are built "on the fly".  Data with differing time
granularities are accommodated.

<LI> Display both real time products and archived products.

<LI> Can export lat-lon coordinates to external programs.  CIDD uses a
shared memory area which allows external programs to read coordinates
(Latitude, Longitude, Altitude and X,Y,Z km, and data time) from the
display.  Current ancillary programs which make use of this interface
include: time_hist; a storm cell analysis tool, pos_report; A position
finder, for reporting relative distances and headings, snow_graph;
which displays precip accumulation rates over time, gauge_strip; shows
time histories of mesonet data closest to the click point, winds_select;
a tool which plots a tabular vertical  profile of model data, metar_select;
which displays a table of the metar data nearest the user selection,
and cidd2skewt; which generates synthetic skewt's from model data.

<P>
<UL>
<LI> Satify everyone.
<LI> Run natively on Microsoft OS'es (Use VNC or Vmware)
