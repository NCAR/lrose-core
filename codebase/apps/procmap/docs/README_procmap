Title:	README for procmap scripts

===========================================================================
The procmap scripts
-------------------

NOTE: the scripts reside in lrose-core/codebase/apps/scripts/src.

The procmap scripts are:

procmap_auto_restart	monitors a list of processes and restarts any that
			are no longer communicating with the 'procmap' process

procmap_list_kill	snuff's a list of processes

procmap_list_start	starts a list of processes

auto_restart		update to procmap_auto_restart to add command line
			options and file locking

auto_restart_stats	parses output from auto_restart to generate
			process restart statistics	

These scripts all operate on a process list file ("proc_list_file") which
contains a list of processes and information about each of the processes.

The proc_list_file
------------------
The proc_list_file has a specific syntax which must be followed. The syntax
is shown in the example below. Comment lines must begin with a leading "#".

#
# Example proc_list_file entries:
#
# process          instance        start script     kill script             host
# --------	   --------	   ------------	    -----------		    ----
#
rdata_to_shmem     rtest           start_ingest     kill_ingest             kodiak
dobson_from_shmem  rtest           start_ingest     kill_ingest             kodiak
dobson_server      ReflFcast       start_servers    kill_dobson_servers     kodiak
dobson_server      rtest           start_servers    kill_dobson_servers     bear
forecast_monitor   Rtest           start_tracking   kill_forecast_monitor   bear
precip_map         precip_fcast    start_tracking   kill_precip_maps        bear
precip_map         precip_accum    start_tracking   kill_precip_maps        bear
storm_track        rtest           start_tracking   kill_storm_track        kodiak
storm_ident        rtest           start_tracking   kill_storm_ident        kodiak
time_hist          rtest           start_display    snuff_inst              kodiak
rview              rtest           start_display    snuff_inst              kodiak

The process, start script, and kill script must be in the current user's 
path. 

You can use enviroment variables in any of the fields in the proc_list_file.
To use environment variables, use the syntax:

$(env-var-string)

For example:

rdata_to_shmem	   rtest           start_ingest     kill_ingest            $(HOST1)


You can use "include files" inside your proc_list_file. The included file 
must be a proc_list_file file and follow the same syntax rules. To include a
file use the syntax:

include filename

For example:

include $(HOME)/params/proc_file_list.include


You can use a special kill script string "snuff_inst" (see the example 
above) in a proc_list_file. This will snuff the process and instance on 
that proc_file_list line without requiring a separate kill script. To use 
snuff_inst, you must have the correct instance in the start script **on the 
command line**; it must match exactly with the instance listed in the 
proc_list_file. For example, to use the following line in the 
proc_file_list:

time_hist          rtest           start_display    snuff_inst              kodiak

you must have the following line in the "start_display" start script:

    time_hist -params time_hist.rtest

or:

    time_hist -params time_hist.params -instance rtest

Installing the procmap scripts
------------------------------
The procmap scripts are now in apps/scripts/src.
When you do a 'make install', the procmap scripts will be installed
into $LROSE_INSTALL_DIR/bin.
