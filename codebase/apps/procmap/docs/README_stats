Title:	README for auto_restart_stats
Date:	09-JUN-1998
Update:	1999
===========================================================================

NOTE: the scripts reside in lrose-core/codebase/apps/scripts/src.

Stats script
------------
A Perl script for generating statistics from the procmap_auto_restart.log
or output from auto_restart is available:

	auto_restart_stats.

It uses the Procmap.pm Perl library (see README_procmap) which must
be available in the location defined by $RAP_LIB_DIR or $RAP_SHARED_LIB_DIR.



Dependencies
------------
The auto_restart_stats script is intended to be run on a project 
PROCMAP_HOST and generate statistics from the following files:

	procmap_auto_restart.log or output from auto_restart
	process list file for the project

In addition, if any environment variables are used in the process
list file they must also be defined in order to run auto_restart_stats.
If accurate restart times are needed for statistics, you must also
be running procmap on the PROCMAP_HOST connected to all the project 
processes.

The process list file is used to calculate the number of machines in
the system and the number of processes.

The procmap_auto_restart.log is parsed for "restart" messages. These
are counted and reported. In addition, the time required to restart
a process (from print_procmap) is counted and reported as "down time".
An option exists to tally the "down time" by process priority. This 
is to separate out important processes from not-so-important processes
whose down-time may not have as large an impact on the system. To use
the process priority, a fifth field must be added to the process list
file for each process. This fifth field (usually an integer) indicates
the process priority for reporting purposes. The priority is ignored
by all the procmap processes and is only used by auto_restart_stats for
reporting.



Limitations
-----------
*Be forewarned* that since processes only log a message when they are
restarted, an "empty file" or no messages in a file will be interpreted
as "success". This means that the start/end times specified to
auto_restart_stats must be carefully chosen to reflect the actual time
span the log file covered. 



Output files
------------
The auto_restart_stats produces 3 output files. They all contain the
same information but in differing levels of detail. By default, the
files are placed into the current directory and have the following names
and contents.

YYYYmmdd_process_total.stats	- least detail, system summary
YYYYmmdd_procmap.stats		- most detailed, system and process level
YYYYmmdd_procmap_summary.stats	- system level detail, no process level

For example (from least to most detail):
