Instructions for 'pecan'.  For other configurations replace 'pecan' with some
other name below, such as 'colo'.


1. Make a copy of the Refractt project
   (be sure to save out your previous version)
          cp -r /scr/tmp/dave/projects  <your place>

2. Edit the environment
          cd <your place>/projects/Refractt/
	  cd envs
	  edit env_set.pecan
	        change RAP_DATA_DIR to your preferred data location
                make sure BIN_DIR is set to /scr/tmp/dave/bin

3. For RefractCalib:  Edit the script environment variables
       cd <your place>/projects/Refractt/alg/bin
       edit start_RefractCalib.pecan

           TARGET_*        = time range for target algorithm
           CALIB_*         = time range for calibration algorithm
           note it is set up for day and night done individually
	   
4. For RefractCalib:  Run the app
       start_RefractCalib.pecan

          Should run and produce output, if you chose a time range that has
	  some data.

          Should produce four output files:

	     1. the reference file(s)
                   $CALIB_FILE_PATH/ref_calib/$CALIB_FILE_NAME_DAY
                   $CALIB_FILE_PATH/ref_calib/$CALIB_FILE_NAME_NIGHT

             2. same data written to standard MDV
  	        yyyymmddhhmmss = time of last data processed,
	        so that it easily can be viewed in CIDD.
                   $CALIB_FILE_PATH/calib/yyyymmdd/hhmmss.mdv

                If day and night are different, there will be two such
		files, with two different times
		
5. For PhaseDiff
       edit the start script and set the range of times
         start_PhaseDiff.pecan
       run 

6. For Refract
       edit the start script and set the range of times
         start_Refract.pecan
       run

7. View in CIDD:
      cd <your_place>projects/Refractt/display/bin
      Optional:
        edit start_CIDD_refractt.pecan
   	     DEMO_TIME = set to the starting time
      start_CIDD_refractt.pecan

    The CIDD params are set up for each app, with data groups:

           PhaseDiff
	   RefractCalib
	   Refract

8. Playing around:

           You can easily have the same calibration used for day AND night
	   by modifying Refract.params and setting both calib files to the same
	   file name.

           You can modify the 'transition between day and night'.  In 
	   Refact.params change this value, currently 0:

                day_night_transition_delta_minutes = 0;

           Then run Refract over a transiton period between day and night
	   or night and day to see the effect. What gets interpolated are
	   the calibration values used by Refract.
