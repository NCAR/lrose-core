1. Add this to your path
   or take the binaries from there and put into your path:

          /scratch/WEEKLY/dave/bin

2. Make a copy of the params/scripts (be sure to save out your previous version)

          cp -r /scragtch/WEEKLY/dave/projects  <your place>

3. Edit the script environment variables

       cd <your place>/projects/Refractt/alg/bin
       edit start_RefractCalib

           CALIB_FILE_PATH = output data location
           TARGET_*        = time range for target algorithm
           CALIB_*         = time range for calibration algorithm

4. Run the app

       start_RefractCalib

          Should run and produce output, if you chose a time range that has
	  some data here:

           rain.eol.ucar.edu:$RAP_DATA_DIR/pecan/cfradial/spol/moments/sband/sur

          Should produce two output files:

	     1. the reference file
                   $CALIB_FILE_PATH/ref_calib/$CALIB_FILE_NAME

             2. same data written as standard MDV
  	        yyyymmddhhmmss = time of last data processed,
	        so that it easily can be viewed in CIDD.
                   $CALIB_FILE_PATH/calib/yyyymmdd/hhmmss.mdv
5. View in CIDD:

      cd <your_place>projects/Refractt/display/bin
      edit start_CIDD
          ALG_PATH = set to same as CALIB_FILE_PATH above
	  DEMO_TIME = set to the starting time
      start_CIDD
          If you set movie to near the processing period latest time, you
	  should be able to display outputs.
