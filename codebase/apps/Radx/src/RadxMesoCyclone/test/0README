To run the algorithm on <host> from here:

1. cp env_<host> env
2. edit env to change things like input and output data locations, time range, etc.
3. put your data in the right place, the location in 'env' by default is:
      $DATA_URL
   this should be data with the fields specified by the environment variable values for:
      $DBZ_NAME
      $VEL_NAME
      
4. If you forget what certain filters do:
      see_Filters
   to see what each one does

5. edit the RadxMesoCyclone param file to your liking
    to turn on and off different output fields, comment out one or more of the lines in output_url
    to change to/from netCDF output, edit UrlOutputs* files and change is_netCDF_output
    change algorithm steps however you want, but make sure to synchronize things with the UrlOutputs* param files regarding names
    and also make sure to edit CIDD.params as well to view any new outputs

6. Run the app:     
      start_Algorithm

7. Display results:
   (Note you need to be logged in with X forwarding)
       start_CIDD

8. IMPORTANT:
   If you make a change and want it to 'stick' you must put it into revision control.
