/**
 AScope provides a traditional real-time Ascope display of
 eldora time series data and computed products. It is implemented
 with Qt, and uses the QtToolbox::ScopePlot as the primary display.
 I&Q, I versus Q, IQ power spectrum, and computed product displays
 are available. The data can be displayed either along the beam
 for all gates, or in time for one gate. Users may select the
 fft block size and the gate to be displayed.

 AScope is simply a data consumer; it does not know
 anything about the data provider. Signals and slots
 used to coordinate with other components.

 It is the responsibility of the data provider to feed data
 at a desired rate. AScope will attempt to render all data
 delivered.

 There are two data areas, _I/_Q and _fftwData, that are dynamically
 resized depending upon the operational mode of the scope.

 _I and _Q contain the I/Q values that are being analyzed. They are
 filled as data is delivered to newTSItemSlot. They will be either
 be the same as the selected block size, if operating in fixed gate
 mode, or the number of gates if operating along beam mode.

 _fftwData is sized to the currently selected block size. Thus this will
 match _I/_Q sizes when operating in fixed gate mode. When in along beam mode,
 this probably not match the number of gates. The _fftwData will be zero padded
 if it is larger than _I/_Q size. If smaller, it will just be filled with
 the leading data from _I/_Q.

 Thus, _I/Q gets resized when the block size is changed, if not operating
 in along beam mode. It gets resized to the number of gates,
 when switching into along beam mode. It gets resized to the block size
 when leaving along beam mode.

 Likewise, _fftwData gets resized when the block size changes. A new
 fftwPlan gets created at the same time.

 The processing of incoming data will be handled differently depending
 upon the type of plot that is currently selected. For instance, if
 a time series or I vs Q  plot by gate is chosen, I and Q are collected
 along the specified gate and displayed. If a power spectrum plot is
 chosen, the I and Q data are collected and then a power spectrum is
 computed. And so on. This work is done in newTSItemSlot(), and then
 the collected data are sent on to proper display method.

 A small QFrame in the controls area is provided for users to add their
 own status widgets, branding, etc.
