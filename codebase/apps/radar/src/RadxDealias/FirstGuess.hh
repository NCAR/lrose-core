 *   UW Radial Velocity Unfolding Algorithm
 *   Four-Dimensional Dealiasing (4DD)
 *
 *   DESCRIPTION:
 *     This algorithm unfolds a volume of single Doppler radial velocity data.
 *   The algorithm uses a previously unfolded volume (or VAD if previous volume
 *   is unavailable) and a higher elevation sweep to unfold some of the bins
 *   in each sweep. Then; it completes the unfolding, assuming spatial
 *   continuity around each bin.
