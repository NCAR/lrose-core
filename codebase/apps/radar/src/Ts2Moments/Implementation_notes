Implementation notes for Ts2Moments
===============================

1. IQ time-series data
----------------------

The IwrfTs classes are used for reading in the time series data.

A IwrfTsPulse object owns the pulse header data and the IQ data.
There is one IwrfTsPulse for each pulse.

A IwrfTsInfo object stores the operational information, which does not
change as fast as the pulse header information. The info is
updated every so often, for example when something changes or once
every tilt.

Pulses and info are read into IwrfTsPulse and IwrfTsInfo objects, 
using a IwrfTsReader object. As currently implemented, the reader
can handle data from a file in SIGMET TsArchive format or a file message
queue (FMQ) in IwrfTs format. The IwrfTs format is specified in
the ds_radar_ts.h header file, in rapformats.

2. Forming pulses into beams
----------------------------

A BeamReader object manages a IwrfTsReader object. It determines when a
series of pulses is ready to be formed into a Beam.

The getNextBeam() method creates a new Beam object and returns it.

Beams may be indexed or not indexed. BeamReader will automatically
switch to non-indexed beams when the antenna azimuth rate drops below
some pre-set value.

3. Beam objects
---------------

A Beam object holds a pointer to a MomentsMgr object. The MomentsMgr objects
are managed by the top level object, Ts2Moments.

When a Beam is created, it loads the IQ data from the IwrfTsPulse objects
into the MomentsMgr object. So Beam does not itself hold the IQ data. This
is done for efficiency. The MomentsMgr objects are long-lived, so the memory
associated with the IQ data, and intermediate results of the moments
computations, is not repeatedly created and destroyed.

The Beam object does own the final moments results. It contains a 
one Field object for unfiltered moments and one Field object for
filtered moments.


4. MomentsMgr objects.
----------------------

A MomentsMgr object is used by a Beam object to manage the moments 
computations. A separate MomentsMgr object is needed for each type
of processing which is required. The processing types are specified
in the parameter file, and the PRF is used to determine which of
a number of possible processing types should be used for a particular
beam.

A MomentsMgr object owns the IQ data for a Beam. This is held in
the form of a vector of GateData objects, one for each gate in the
beam.

The IQ data is loaded into the GateData vector by the loadBeamData()
method, which is called by a Beam when it is constructed. This method
handles the copying of IQ data from the pulse objects to the
MomentsMgr object. Once a Beam has been constructed, the Pulse objects
can be freed.

A MomentsMgr object holds a Moments object, which holds the code
for actually computing the moments. You can think of it in this way:
the MomentsMgr object is responsible for marshalling the data and
getting it into the correct place. The Moments obeject is responsible
for actually computing the moments.

The MomentMgr object also manages clutter filtering. It has a CMD
object, which computes the likelihood of clutter at a gate. Filtering
itself is done by the Moments objects, which in turn hold a ClutFilter
object.

The MomentMgr object contains two vectors of MomentsThread objects,
one for handling moments computations and one for handling IQ filtering.
Each MomentsThread object contains an Fft object, so that fftw only 
requires initialization at program startup. This improves efficiency.

When the MomentsMgr computeMoments() method is called, it spawns
a number of threads, some for computing moments and some for filtering
the IQ data for computing filtered moments. The order of computation 
is as follows:

  * compute unfiltered moments, using unfiltered IQ
  * compute CMD to determine which gates to filter
  * compute filtered IQ at gates indicated by CMD
  * compute filtered moments from filtered IQ

5. Moments objects
------------------

Each MomentsMgr object contains a Moments object. This is responsible
for actually computing the moments.

The Moments class has code for handling the different polarization
possiblities, such as single-pol, dual pol alternating, dual pol
simultaneous etc.

There are two methods for each type of processing. One method accepts
IQ data. The other method accepts pre-computed co-variances. The former
methods are called from the MomentsMgr. The latter methods are suitable
for post-processing in which only the co-variances are available.

The moments computations are identical for filtered or unfiltered
data. For filtered moments, the IQ data is filtered prior to calling
the Moments methods.

Each Moments object holds a ClutFilter object, which 

6. Clutter Mitigation Decision (CMD)
------------------------------------

CMD uses fuzzy-logic reasoning to determine which gates are likely to 
have clutter and which should not be filtered. CMD uses pre-computed
moments for a Beam.

The Cmd object computes a number of 'feature fields', such as the texture
of reflectivity and the standard deviation of ZDR.

Each Cmd object has a series of InterestMap objects, which are used
to convert the feature field values into interest values, which range from
0 to 1. The fuzzy-logic math is done on the interest fields. A combined
CMD field is computed, which is a fuzzy combination of the interest fields.

The combined CMD interest field indicates the likelihood of clutter at a
gate. A threshold is applied to the field. A flag is set at each gate
for which the combined interest exceeds a set threshold (normally 0.5).

7. ClutFilter
-------------

The ClutFilter class contains only static methods, which
filter IQ data using the Spectral Static Echo Filter (SSEF).

8. Calibration data
-------------------

The Calibration class holds the calibration data. The main Ts2Moments object
holds a calibration object, which is initialized when the application starts.
Calibration data is required, the app will exit if reading the calibration
data fails.

Optionally, new calibration data can be read from a directory. For this to
work, calibration files must be written to a specified directory.

When Ts2Moments processes a Beam object, it sets the calibration data for
that Beam using the latest available calibration. The calibration data
is then owned by that Beam. It is used in the moments computations and
written out with the moments data.

9. OutputFmq
------------

Moments are written by Ts2Moments to a moments file message queue (FMQ) by an
OutputFmq object. The format is the RAL DsRadar format, specified in
the rapformats library.

10. Ts2Moments
----------

Ts2Moments is the main object for this application. There is only one
Ts2Moments object.

Ts2Moments owns the following:

  * 1 BeamReader object
  * 1 OutputFmq object
  * 1 Calibration object
  * a vector of MomentsMgr objects

The MomentsMgr vector is actually a vector of

  vector<MomentsMgr *> _momentsMgrArray[2];

So, for every processing type there are 2 MomentsMgr objects. This is
done to handle threading, which will be dealt with below. The MomentsMgr
object holds the GateData for the beam.  This is loaded in the reader
thread, and used in the compute thread. These threads run concurrently.
Therefore, the MomentsMgr associated with a consecutive beams toggles
between the two available managers.

11. Threading
-------------

There are two levels of multi-threading in the application.

At the top level, the following threads exist, as a pipeline:

  * read  thread
  * main  thread
  * write thread

The timing is as follows:

  Time    Read             Main (compute)     Write
          thread           thread             thread

  1       reading-beam-1
  2       reading-beam-2   computing-beam-1
  3       reading-beam-3   computing-beam-2   writing-beam-1
  4       reading-beam-4   computing-beam-3   writing-beam-2
  5       reading-beam-5   computing-beam-4   writing-beam-3

The concurrency of one time step between the read thread and the
compute thread is the reason why 2 MomentsMgr objects are required.
One MomentsMgr is being loaded with IQ data while another is being
used in the computations. These toggle each time step.

The second level of threading exists in the Main (compute) thread.
When the moments computations are done, the gates are divided into
a number of segments in range. Computing the moments for each segment
is handled by a different thread.

The MomentsMgr actually spawns 3 sets of compute threads. The sequence
of events is as follows:

  1. Spawn threads to compute unfiltered moments
  2. Wait for unfiltered moments to complete.
  3. Compute CMD - clutter likelihood.
  4. Spawn threads to filter IQ data.
  5. Wait for IQ filtering to complete.
  6. Spawn threads to compute filtered moments
  7. Wait for filtered moments to complete.
