Place the cursor over the button and press the
left mouse button to start or stop the movie
loop.  The display may take a few moments to
load the appropriate data, and then will show
approximately the last 60 minutes of measured
reflectivity and 30 minutes of forecasts. 

Note that the clock face in the upper right
corner of the depicts the local time data were
measured for each of the sequence of frames in
the loop. A  GMT time is also availible in the
label at the top of the image.  The NEXRAD
radars scan irregularly, so the images are
approximately ten minutes apart. One can vary
the speed of the movie loop by clicking and
holding the left mouse button with the cursor
over the "SPEED" slide bar just to the right of
the three buttons at the top of the planview,
and sliding the bar.

To stop the loop, deselect the "LOOP" button with
the left mouse button. The planview will revert
back to the most recent NEXRAD frame. The display
automatically updates with new data as it arrives.

:canvas
This window depicts the region around O'Hare
Airport and shows the current and forecast
radar data From the NEXRAD radar located at
Lockport IL.

The intensity of the radar return is indicated
by the dBZ color scale on the right hand side
of the window. Remember; RADARS ONLY TELL WHERE
THE PRECIP IS, NOT HOW MUCH PRECIP THERE IS.

Create a movie loop of the past 60 minutes and
future 30 minutes of radar data by clicking on
the "LOOP" button on the upper left border of
the display.

Different Radar data sets can be selected by
choosing the appropriate option from the
"FIELD" button.

Zoom in or out to pre-defined or user selected
aspects by clicking on the "VIEW" button
located on the upper left border of the display
and selecting one of the options.

User defined zooms are generated by dragging
the left mouse button through the desired area
and then releasing. The middle button, when
held down and dragged, will move the viewable
area.

The view also depicts local landmarks , such as
nearby airports, O'Hare Airport, and Lake
Michigan. Range rings are included. The
asterisks indicate the location of snowgauges.

Clicking near an asterisk with the left mouse
button will generate a new Precipitation
Accumulation Plot in the lower right hand
corner of the screen. The chart will update and
show a history of local average DBZ and the
precip accumulations from the nearest precip
sensor.  It takes a few seconds for the plot to
calculate and display the precip accumulations
in the specific area selected.
