Getting Started				How to familiarize yourself with HawkEdit Scripts
    VZ_COPY = VZ 			Copy VZ data to new field VZ_COPY
    VZ2 = VZ * 2.0			Multiply data in field VZ by 2.0

Bad Flag functions			All use a field that contains bad flags
    bad flag mask			a field that contains bad data value to mark gates with bad data
    AND_BAD_FLAG_ABOVE(<field>, <real>, <bad flag mask>)			AND the result of (field > real) with the bad flags mask.  If the test field is flagged bad the flag in the bad flags mask is turned off otherwise the condition is ANDed with the corresponding bad flag.  e.g.  and-bad-flags when SW above 4.4 and-bad-flags when VE between -1. and 1.  
    ASSERT_BAD_FLAGS			Arranging widgets on a form
    Example: remove clutter from VE and DZ fields
        VE2 = SET_BAD_FLAGS_BETWEEN (VE, -1, 1., BAD_FLAGS)  
        DZ2 = AND_BAD_FLAGS_ABOVE (DZ, 35., BAD_FLAGS)  
        VE3 = ASSERT_BAD_FLAGS (BAD_FLAGS) 
        DZ3 = ASSERT_BAD_FLAGS (DZ, BAD_FLAGS) 		Turning off the flag when the test field contains a delete flag for AND only guarentees that the absence of a reflectivity will not cause a velocity value between -1. and 1. to be deleted in the above example.  
Threshold 
    THRESHOLD_ABOVE(VZ, 3.5)		Putting widgets into the dialog example
    Example: 				Making widget communicate with each other

Unfold or Dealias 			Unfold a field based on Nyquist velocity 
    Variables				Using a form without any adjustments
    Default Values			Using a form without any adjustments
    BB_UNFOLD()				Subclassing a form's base class
    Example:  Connections		Connecting widgets using a naming scheme
        A Dialog Without Auto-Connect	How to connect widgets without a naming scheme
        A Dialog With Auto-Connect	Using automatic connections

Remove Ring 				How to edit a form in Qt Designer
    Variables 				Loading and saving forms
    Default Values			Basic editing techniques
    REMOVE_RING()			Changing widget properties
    Example:				Objects that arrange widgets on a form
        Applying and Breaking Layouts	Managing widgets in layouts 
        Horizontal and Vertical Layouts	Standard row and column layouts
        The Grid Layout			Arranging widgets in a matrix
    Previewing Forms			Checking that the design works
