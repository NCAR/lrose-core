    Note 2: Format description of the ASCII-text attribute specifications.

    1. The attributes are represented by an ASCII string. The string consists
    of a number of sections terminated by ";", each of which specifies an
    applicable attribute. ";" after the last section is optional. Each section
    must be in the form of "attribute name = attribute description" where
    "attribute name" must be one of the following: "name", "type", "unit",
    "range", "value", "default", "accuracy", "description", "conversion" and
    "exception". The attribute name is case-insensitive. That is, for example,
    "name", "Name" and "NAME" are all valid and identical. "attribute
    description" is a character string that describes the value of the
    attribute as explained in the following.

    2. Attribute description:

	"name": The name of the parameter. An example is 
	"name = 2D feature altitude".

	"type": One of the following type names: "int", "short", "byte"
	(4-byte, 2-byte and 1-byte integer respectively),"float", "double" 
	(4-byte and 8-byte IEEE floating point numbers respectively), "string"
	(ASCII character string), "uint", "ushort" and "ubyte" (unsigned 
	versions of int, short and byte). An example is "type = int". The type 
	name is case-insensitive.

	"unit": The physical unit of the data value. Standard unit names are to
	be defined. Examples are "unit = meter" and "unit = percent".

	"range": The set of all valid values for the parameter. The range can
	be specified with one of the following three formats:

	    a. Single interval specification defined by "[min, max]" where
	    "min" and "max" are respectively the minimum and maximum values.
	    "[" and "]" can be replaced by "(" and ")" respectively if the
	    boundary is not inclusive. Unlimited boundary is specified by "-".
	    Examples are "range = [1, 2]", "range = (1, 2]", "range = [1., -)",
	    "range = [A, Z]" (character string type), and "range = (-, -)".

	    b. A list of valid values: { v1, v2, ...}. Examples are "range =
	    {1, 2, 3}" and "range = {reflectivity, velocity, spectrum width}.

	    c. A named method that checks the range. The method name is
	    enclosed by "<" and ">". The method must be described elsewhere.

	"value" and "default": A value or a list of values separated by ",".
	Examples are "value = 1", "value = 1.0, 2., 3.0" and "value = Yes, No".

	"accuracy": The accuracy of the data. [max_error] is used for the
	absolute maximum error and (max_error) for the relative maximum error.

	"description": A text description of the data.

	"conversion": The way to convert binary data stored externally. The
	conversion can be specified with one of the following formats:

	    a. Format [scale, offset] is used for scale-offset type of
	    conversion: value = data * scale + offset. An example is
	    "conversion = [2., 64.]".

	    b. Format {valueMap, data1, value1, data2, value2, ...} for data
	    mapping conversions. Where "valueMap" is a reserved key word.
	    "data1", "data2" ... are the data and "value1", "value2" ... are
	    the values to convert to. An example is "conversion = {valueMap, 1,
	    -5., 2, 0., 3, 50., 4, 100.}".

	    c. Format <method> is used for named conversion method. The method 
	    must be described elsewhere.

	    Elements of binary data array are assumed to be stored one after
	    another in the local byte order for types other than "bit" and
	    "string". For type "bit", we assume that the elements are stored in
	    a byte array each of which holds 8 elements. The first bit element
	    is stored in the left-most bit in the bytes. For type "string",
	    elements are null-terminated strings and stored one after another
	    with the null terminator.

	"exception": A list of the exceptional data values and their meanings.
	An example is "exception = 0, below threshold, 1, missing data".
	Standard vocabulary for describing exceptional values needs to be
	established in the future.

    3. When characters ";", "=" and "," are used for formatting purpose,
    characters "space", "tab" and "line return" surrounding them are
    insignificant. That is, for example, "name = short", "name=short" and 
    "name   =short" are all identical. Non-formatting use of ";" and "," are
    allowed if no ambiguity is introduced. In case of ambiguity, "\" can be
    used in front of characters ";" and "," to indicate that they are not
    interpreted as formatting characters. The part of "Attribute description"
    is case-sensitive except otherwise specified.
