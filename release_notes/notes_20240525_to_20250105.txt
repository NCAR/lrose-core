    Leosphere format update (#134)
    * Update for recent leosphere file format changes: sweep group attribute res_id is now an int attribute, not a string attribute. Catch exception of trying to convert an int to a string, and instead get its value as an int and then convert to string.
    * Oops, fix degree symbols
    * Oops, fix degree symbols, again
    * Update wording on combineRHI errors: change error to warning when trying to combine RHI on non RHI files, since file processing still works apart from combining RHI, make wording on multiple sweeps error a little clearer.

    clean up handling of tdrp_gen during build
    
    Creation of Params.hh and Params.cc files during build no longer
    requires an installed version of tdrp_gen. Instead, the tdrp_gen
    created in the build tree is now explicitly used if Params files must
    be generated while building.
    
    This means that tdrp_gen is now never installed unless the user
    runs "make install".
