# Building LROSE manually - LINUX

Setting up the manual build environment allows a user to
develop LROSE-specific code in an efficient environment.

It uses Makefiles that are simple to use, rather than the complex makefiles generated
by the GNU tools autoconf and automake.

## 1. Prepare the OS

Most good, up-to date LINUX distributions should work.

Recommended distributions are:

  * Debian
  * Ubuntu (based on Debian)
  * RedHat
  * Centos (based on RedHat)
  * Fedora (based on RedHat)

Install the required packages. See:

* [LROSE package dependencies](./lrose_package_dependencies.md)

## 2. Download from GitHub

Create a working directory for cloning:

```
  mkdir -p ~/git
  cd ~/git
```

### Clone the current lrose-core version from GitHub

```
  cd ~/git
  git clone https://github.com/ncar/lrose-core 
```

The distribution will be in the lrose-core subdirectory:

```
  cd ~/git/lrose-core
```

<a name="setenv"/>

## 3. Setting up your environment

The LROSE manual build uses a recursive makefile approach, using environment variables to identify the various directories to be used during the build.

For details on the makefile system, see:

* [LROSE_manual_make_system.md](./LROSE_manual_make_system.md)

### Set environment variables for the build:

For sh or bash:
```
export HOST_OS=LINUX_LROSE
export LROSE_INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/lrose
export LROSE_CORE_DIR=$HOME/git/lrose-core
```

For csh or tcsh:
```
setenv HOST_OS LINUX_LROSE
setenv LROSE_INSTALL_DIR $HOME/lrose
setenv LROSE_CORE_DIR $HOME/git/lrose-core
```

Preferably, you should permanently set these directly in your `.cshrc` or `.bashrc` file.
Then the environment will always be correctly set.

LROSE will be installed in:
```
  $LROSE_INSTALL_DIR/bin
  $LROSE_INSTALL_DIR/lib
  $LROSE_INSTALL_DIR/include
```
 
<a name="build-using-script"/>

## 4. Build using python script provided

You can choose to build manually from the command line, or you
can use the python script provided.

The script ```build_lrose_manual.py``` is in ```lrose-core/build```.

The usage is:
```
  build_lrose_manual.py --help
  Usage: build_lrose_manual.py [options]
  Options:
    -h, --help         show this help message and exit
    --debug            Set debugging on
    --verbose          Set verbose debugging on
    --package=PACKAGE  Package name. Options are: lrose-core (default), lrose-
                       blaze, lrose-cyclone, lrose-cidd
    --prefix=PREFIX    Prefix name for install location
    --scripts          Install scripts as well as binaries

```

If you run using the defaults, it will install the lrose-core package into $HOME/lrose.

If you want to install the real-time runtime scripts, use ```--scripts```.

## 5. Build manually

### First install the makefiles if not building lrose-core

The `make` application can use makefiles named either `Makefile` or `makefile`.
The lower-case version takes preference.

The codebase contains upper-case Makefiles appropriate for building **lrose-core**.
If you are building lrose-core, you do not need this step.

If you are building a different version - for example **samurai**, you will need to install the makefiles for that version.

For the **samurai** distribtion, run the following:

```
  cd $LROSE_CORE_DIR
  ./build/scripts/installPackageMakefiles.py --package samurai
```

To re-install the **lrose-core** standard package Makefiles, perform the following:

```
  cd $LROSE_CORE_DIR
  ./build/scripts/installPackageMakefiles.py
```

since lrose-core is the default package.

### Perform the build

#### (a) Build and install the TDRP parameter handling utility

```
  cd $LROSE_CORE_DIR/codebase/libs/tdrp/src
  make install
  cd $LROSE_CORE_DIR/codebase/apps/tdrp/src/tdrp_gen
  make install
```

#### (b) Build and install the libraries

```
  cd $LROSE_CORE_DIR/codebase/libs/
  make -j 8 install_include
  make -j 8 install
```

#### (c) Build and instal the applications

```
  cd $LROSE_CORE_DIR/codebase/apps
  make -j 8 install
```

### Building individual applications

Once you have set up the environment specified above, you are free
to edit and build individual applications.

For example, if you want to work on RadxConvert, you would go
to the relevant directory and perform the build locally there.

```
  cd $LROSE_CORE_DIR/codebase/apps/Radx/src/RadxConvert
  make clean
  make
  make install
```
