Question:

Please list the steps required to build a C++ package for conda-forge?

Answer:

To build and submit a C++ package to **conda-forge**, you generally follow these steps:

### 1. **Create a Recipe for the Package**
The first step is to create a **conda recipe** for your C++ package. The recipe is a set of files that describe how to build and install your package.

#### Steps to Create a Recipe:
1. **Set up conda-build:**
   Ensure you have `conda-build` installed to create and test the recipe:
   ```bash
   conda install conda-build
   ```

2. **Create a `meta.yaml` File:**
   The `meta.yaml` file contains metadata about your package (name, version, source, dependencies, etc.).
   
   Here’s an example structure of a `meta.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   package:
     name: my_cpp_package
     version: "1.0.0"
   
   source:
     url: https://example.com/my_cpp_package-1.0.0.tar.gz
     sha256: <checksum>
   
   build:
     number: 0
     script: |
       mkdir build
       cd build
       cmake ..
       make
       make install

   requirements:
     build:
       - cmake
       - make
       - gxx_linux-64  # or clangxx_osx-64 if building for macOS
     host:
       - cmake
     run:
       - libstdcxx-ng  # or other C++ runtime libraries
   ```

3. **Prepare Build/Install Scripts:**
   Ensure that your package can be built via CMake (or another build system). If you use CMake, modify the `meta.yaml` to include the correct build steps.

### 2. **Test the Recipe Locally**
Before submitting the recipe to conda-forge, you should test it locally using `conda-build`.

1. **Build the package locally:**
   In the directory with your recipe (`meta.yaml`), run:
   ```bash
   conda-build .
   ```

2. **Install and test locally:**
   Once built, install it with:
   ```bash
   conda install --use-local my_cpp_package
   ```

3. **Test the package:**
   Make sure the installation works and all binaries/libraries are functioning as expected.

### 3. **Submit the Recipe to `staged-recipes`**
After testing locally, submit your recipe to the conda-forge **staged-recipes** repository.

#### Steps:
1. **Fork `staged-recipes` Repo:**
   Go to the [staged-recipes repo](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes), fork it to your own GitHub account, and clone the forked repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/staged-recipes.git
   ```

2. **Create a Directory for Your Package:**
   In your cloned `staged-recipes` repo, create a new directory under `recipes/` for your package:
   ```bash
   mkdir recipes/my_cpp_package
   ```

3. **Add Your Recipe Files:**
   Copy your `meta.yaml` (and any build or test scripts) to the new `recipes/my_cpp_package/` directory.

4. **Open a Pull Request (PR):**
   Push your changes to your forked repository and open a PR to the `staged-recipes` repository:
   ```bash
   git add recipes/my_cpp_package
   git commit -m "Add recipe for my_cpp_package"
   git push origin master
   ```
   Then go to the [staged-recipes GitHub page](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pulls) and create a PR.

5. **Wait for Review and Feedback:**
   The conda-forge team will review your PR. They might request changes, such as improving the build process, ensuring compatibility with multiple platforms, or making dependencies explicit.

### 4. **Conda-Forge Feedstock Creation**
Once your recipe is accepted, conda-forge will create a **feedstock** for your package. The feedstock is a dedicated GitHub repository that automates the building and updating of your package on conda-forge.

1. **Monitor the feedstock creation:**
   After your PR is merged, a feedstock repository will be created automatically (it typically takes a few minutes).

2. **Check Build Status:**
   Conda-forge’s CI systems will automatically attempt to build your package for different platforms (Linux, macOS, and Windows). You can monitor the progress by checking the feedstock’s CI logs on platforms like Travis CI, CircleCI, Azure, or GitHub Actions.

3. **Fix Any Issues:**
   If the build fails for any platform, you'll need to update the feedstock repository with changes to the recipe. The feedstock repo will automatically synchronize with conda-forge’s CI systems.

### 5. **Maintaining Your Package**
Once the feedstock is created, you will be added as a **maintainer** for the package, and the feedstock repository will allow you to:
- **Update the package version** when new releases of your package are available.
- **Fix build issues** or adjust dependencies by modifying the recipe in the feedstock repository.

You can push updates to the feedstock repository directly, and it will trigger rebuilds on conda-forge’s CI infrastructure.

### Summary of Steps:
1. Write a `meta.yaml` file for the package recipe.
2. Test the recipe locally with `conda-build`.
3. Fork and clone the conda-forge `staged-recipes` repository.
4. Submit a PR to `staged-recipes` with your recipe.
5. After review and acceptance, monitor the feedstock and address build issues if necessary.
6. Maintain the feedstock for future updates.

### 6. **Testing - specified in meta.yaml file**

You can specify tests to validate the build under the `test` section. This section allows you to define commands, files, imports, or other checks to ensure that the package works as expected after installation.

Here’s how you can structure the `test` section in the `meta.yaml`:

#### Example:

```yaml
test:
  # List of commands to run after the build to validate it
  commands:
    - my_command --version
    - another_command --help

  # Files that should be present after the build
  files:
    - bin/my_executable
    - lib/libmylibrary.so

  # Modules to import as a test (for Python packages)
  imports:
    - my_python_module
    - another_module

  # Environment variables for the test
  env:
    MY_ENV_VAR: some_value

  # Extra dependencies needed for running tests
  requires:
    - pytest
    - nose

  # List of source files for Python or other tests
  source_files:
    - tests/test_my_package.py
```

#### Breakdown of the `test` section:
1. **`commands`**: Shell commands that should be executed after the package is installed to verify it's functioning properly.
2. **`files`**: Ensure certain files are present after installation (useful for binary packages).
3. **`imports`**: Test whether certain Python modules can be imported (useful for Python packages).
4. **`env`**: Set environment variables during testing if needed.
5. **`requires`**: List of additional dependencies required for the tests (these will be installed only in the testing environment).
6. **`source_files`**: Specify custom test files that should be included in the test environment.

This structure ensures that the package is working properly after being built and installed.
