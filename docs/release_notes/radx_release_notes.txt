Release notes, 2016/03/27
=========================

Fixed bug in RadxTimeList, which was causing a core dump on MacOSX.

Release notes, 2016/03/24
=========================

For NOXP files, fixed bug in setting the fixed angle in RHI mode.

Release notes, 2016/03/22
=========================

In SigmetRadxFile class, improved handling of NOAA Tail radar data.
Specifically removed automatic application of georef data to azimuth and elevation.
This leaves azimuth set to the rotation angle, and elevation set to tilt.
In RadxConvert, you must use -apply_georefs to force application of georef information
to compute azimuth and elevation in earth-centric corrds.

Release notes, 2016/01/27
=========================

(a) Added OSX support.
    Added OSX binary release.

(b) Modified RapicRadxFile.cc, so that sweep number is computed positionally
    instead of getting the sweep number from the data. This is in response
    to an error in the sweep number in some file.

(c) In RadxConvert, added the -vol_num and -vol_num_auto args, to allow the
    user to specify the starting volume number for a series of files, and 
    have the volume number automatically increment by file.

Additions to Radx lib, 2015/08/26
=================================

Added install_devel_release script.

install_bin_release only installs the binaries.

install_devel_release installs the library and include files as well.


Additions to Radx lib, 2015/07/04
=================================

(a) ray times for SIGMET files with HRD headers should now
be accurate at sub-second level

(b) Lower fuselage radar on NOAA aircraft should produce
PPI files instead of tail radar files

(c) Added support for reading latest TWOLF files

(d) Added capability to have different start range / gate spacing
for different rays in a volume.


Bug fixes for Radx lib, 2014/05/23
==================================

RadxConvert in archive mode
---------------------------

Modified RadxConvert to properly handle archive mode.

This means you can use:

  RadxConvert -start "yyyy mm dd hh mm ss" -end "yyyy mm dd hh mm ss" ....

Now works for NEXRAD files.

Generally, it is recommended that you put your files in dated day directories.
For example:

  topdir/20140523/files....

and use

  -indir topdir

on the command line.

However, it should also work if you point to the directory in which
the files themselves reside, provided they have the date and time
encoded in the file names:

  *yyyymmdd?yymmss*


Bug fixes for Radx lib, 2014/04/14
==================================

Bug fixes
----------

A number of bugs were taken care of.

Bug fixes for Radx lib, 2014/04/01
==================================

Mac OS Support
--------------

Improved brew formulas, and mac support for HDF5 C++.

Brew is recommended as the way to build Radx on a mac.

DORADE reading
--------------

Added check for MAXCVGATES.

CfRadial reading
----------------

(a) If data is Nan, set to missing.
(b) If lat/lon/alt is missing, set to 0.
(c) In instrument name and site name, replace any spaces with
    underscores on read.

General bug fixes
-----------------

A number of bugs were taken care of.

Bug fixes for Radx lib, 2013/12/23
==================================

GAMIC HDF5 support
------------------

Added read support for GAMIC HDF5 volume data.

This is automatic - just point to a GAMIC file and it should read it.

ODIM HDF5 support
-----------------

Added read support for ODIM HDF5 volume data.

This is automatic - just point to a ODIM file and it should read it.

Write support will be added later.

Bug fixes for Radx lib, 2013/11/21
==================================

TDWR support
------------

Added read support for TDWR volume data.

This is automatic - just point to a TDWR file and it should read it.

SIGMET HRD extended header support
----------------------------------

Added support for HRD extended headers in Sigmet RAW data.

The following environment variables are applicable to the
decoding of HRD extended headers:

By default the IRS data is used for position and the AAMPS
data for winds.

To use GPS data for position, set:

  HRD_USE_GPS_POSN = true

To use AAMPS data for position, set:

  HRD_USE_AAMPS_POSN = true

To use IRS data for winds, set:

  HRD_USE_IRS_WIND = true

LEOSPHERE support
-----------------

Fixed problem related to elevation angles > 180.
Force all elevations between -180 and +180.

GOEREFERENCE data into CfRadial
-------------------------------

Updated the code so that only Georeference fields with some
non-missing data are written to the file.

If all of the entries in a particular goereference field (for example
roll) are missing, this field will not be written to the file.

RadxConvert - option to set data types on write
-----------------------------------------------

Added option to set the data type of all fields on write.

The may be controlled either on the command line or via the 
parameter file.

On the command line, use:

  -to_float32
  -to_int32
  -to_int16
  -to_int08

In the param file, use the following params:

  set_output_encoding_for_all_fields = TRUE;
  output_encoding = OUTPUT_ENCODING_FLOAT32; (or whatever)

File aggregation on read
------------------------

Reviewed code and fixed number of bugs related to file aggregation
on read.

This applies to RadxConvert and RadxPrint.

RadxPartRain
------------

Fixed bug related to:

  PARTICLE_ID2: the second most likely id type
  PID_INTEREST2: the interest value for PARTICLE_ID2

Bug fixes for Radx lib, 2013/10/23
==================================

RadxPartRain
------------

Added the following output fields:

  PARTICLE_ID2: the second most likely id type
  PID_INTEREST2: the interest value for PARTICLE_ID2

Bug fixes for Radx lib, 2013/10/11
==================================

Reading DORADE data with aggregation
------------------------------------

Sometimes (as in SPOL data) volume numbers are repeated in a single
day's observations. There was a bug that caused aggregation of all
sweeps with the same volume number into a volume. This was fixed -
now, only the sweeps with that volume number in the immediate vicinity
of the requested volume in time are included.

Writing/reading height agl to/from CfRadial
-------------------------------------------

Previously, for a fixed radar, the height AGL was not written to the
CfRadial file, nor read from it. This was fixed.

Reading angle resolution - CfRadial
-----------------------------------

Reads angle resolution from CfRadial, even if rays are not indexed.

Flag to indicate rays are in ascending order
--------------------------------------------

Improved checking for rays in ascending order.
Set flag accordingly.

Universal file support
----------------------

Fixed various bugs related to reading/writing UF files.

Foray file support
------------------

Relaxed the FORAY format requirements so that Radar_Constant is
no longer required, and maxSystems can be used instead of
numSystems.
