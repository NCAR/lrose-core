## Running LROSE

### Running LROSE server-based applications

If you are making use of the data server applications in LROSE, you will need
to disable the firewall on your host, or open up the ports between 5300 and 5500.

To disable the firewall on a RedHat-based host:

```
  systemctl stop firewalld
  systemctl stop iptables
```
