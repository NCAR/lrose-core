## 1. Prepare

Most good, up-to date LINUX distributions should work.

Recommended distributions are:

  * Debian
  * Ubuntu (based on Debian)
  * RedHat
  * Centos (based on RedHat)
  * Fedora (based on RedHat)

First, you will need to install the required packages.

See: [LROSE package dependencies](../build//lrose_package_dependencies.md)

## 2. Download

### Create a working directory for building the distribution:

```
  mkdir ~/lrose_build
  cd ~/lrose_build
```

### Download the source release for Linux

Download the source tar file from:

```
 Â https://github.com/NCAR/lrose-core/releases 
```

A typical source release would be:

```
  lrose-20160823.src.tgz
```

### Untar

```
  tar xvfz lrose-20160823.src.tgz
```

The distribution will be unpacked into a subdirectory:

```
  cd ~/lrose_build/lrose-20160823.src
```

<a name="build"/>

## 3. Build

### Run the build script:

To see the usage:

```
  ./build_src_release.py --help
```

To build and install into the default directory: `~/lrose`

```
  ./build_src_release.py
```

Or set an install directory:

```
  ./build_src_release.py --prefix /my/install/dir
```

<a name="verify"/>

## 4. Verify

Look in ~/lrose or /my/install/dir for

```
  include
  lib
  bin
```

Try the commands:
```
  ~/lrose/bin/RadxPrint -h
  ~/lrose/bin/RadxConvert -h
  ~/lrose/bin/Radx2Grid -h
  ~/lrose/bin/HawkEye
```

## 5. Handling build errors

If the build does not complete successfully, you will need to
track down the errors.

The very first errors in the build are the most important.

If you get errors, go into the directory giving problems, and
run the make as follows:

```
  make |& less
```

and scroll down searchinf for `error`.

Alternatively, run

```
  make >& make.log
```

and then inspect the make.log file, searching for `error`.

## 6. Update

To update, just repeat the procedure in sections 2, 3 and 4 above.

The new version will be installed over the previous version.
