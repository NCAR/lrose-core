## LROSE - The Lidar Radar Open Software Environment

This distribution contains the core software for LROSE.

### Building LROSE

You can build LROSE using either of the following:

  * NCAR development environment build
  * automake configure-based build
  * download pre-configured source distribution

If you are performing development, it is probably better to have the NCAR development environment.

If you just wish to use the software, the automake/configure build is preferable.

See [README_BUILD.md](./docs/README_BUILD.md) for details.
