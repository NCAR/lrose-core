## LROSE - The Lidar Radar Open Software Environment

This distribution contains the core software for LROSE.

### Building LROSE

You can build LROSE using either of the following:

  * NCAR development build environment
  * automake configure-based build

If you are performing development, it is probably better to have the NCAR development environment.

If you just wish to use the software, the automake/configure build is preferable.

#### Buildling with the NCAR development environment

See:

[README_NCAR_BUILD.md](./codebase/build/README_NCAR_BUILD.md)

for details.
